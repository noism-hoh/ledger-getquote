# getquote scripts for Ledger

`getquote` is used by [Ledger](http://github.com/ledger/ledger) for fetching exchange rates from the web. Here you can find some example `getquote` scripts. You can freely tweak them to suit your need.

## Usage

The provided script is not executable as it's just a starting point for you to write your own `getquote` script. And, of course, it's pretty well-documented.

After customizing the script, if it finally can fetch the rates for you, great! For Ledger to use your `getquote`, please drop the script into somewhere in your PATH, e.g. `~/.local/bin`
